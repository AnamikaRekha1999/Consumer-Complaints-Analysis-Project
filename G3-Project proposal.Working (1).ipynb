We implemented classification models that predicted the category of a new complaint based on its attributes using logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, naive bayes, KNN and SGD Classifier.\n",

We investigated the analysis's shortcomings and discuss about how it may be enhanced in subsequent versions. The overall goal of this research is to show how machine learning can be used to analyze enormous datasets and extract insightful data.\n"

On the test set, predictions are made, and the classifier's accuracy is assessed.

    "Preprocessing the data included dealing with category variables and missing values. Predictive models were created using a variety of machine learning methods, such as Random Forest, Linear SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, and an ensemble of these classifiers. The models' accuracy rates were high, ranging from 92% to 94%. Some models demonstrated a modest increase in accuracy after calibrating. \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparable results were achieved by the ensemble model, which incorporated predictions from various classifiers. The calibration step improved the accuracy of various models, especially Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The model accuracies were displayed using a line plot, which highlighted the influence of calibration. The project's overall results showed how crucial data pretreatment, model choice, and calibration are to making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    " Machine learning models can perform better by using the ensemble model and calibration procedures. The project also involved using the SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) classification technique to determine the anticipated category of a specific complaint issue in addition to the aforementioned phases. In place of the previous machine learning models, this algorithm was utilized. Additionally, a priority list was made based on the number of each issue, giving each group a priority value. By providing more emphasis to issues that were occurring more frequently, this prioritization enabled the designated companies to address and resolve complaints in accordance with a predetermined pattern. This priority list was created with the intention of streamlining the complaint process and guaranteeing that urgent matters receive timely consideration.\n",
